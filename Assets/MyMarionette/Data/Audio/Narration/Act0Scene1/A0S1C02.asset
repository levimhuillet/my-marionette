  subtitle: "Great, the joint needs some new faces around here. Been working here,
    oh, I don\u2019t know, ten, twenty years. I\u2019d swear the damn dolls are talking
    to me at this point (sarcastic). Richard\u2019s good company, though. Well, good
    enough. He had to take care of something, otherwise he\u2019d usually be the
    one talking with you right now. We\u2019ll probably see him around, eventually.
    Here, this way."
