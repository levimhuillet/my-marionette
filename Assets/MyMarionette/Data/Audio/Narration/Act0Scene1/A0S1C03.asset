  subtitle: " I\u2019ll make sure the guys have the scene set up for you at least
    an hour beforehand. For now, the script\u2019s still a little bit up in the air.
    Richard told me to dig up one of the shows from \u201868 for tonight, but a third
    of the pages are tattered or just lost altogether. Since you\u2019re a writer
    and all though, was hoping you could just read it over and fill in the missing
    pieces with whatever you think. Full creative discretion, every artist\u2019s
    dream, right?"
