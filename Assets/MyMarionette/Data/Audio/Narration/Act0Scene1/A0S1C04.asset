  subtitle: "Great, last order of business. Characters and props are over there in
    the chest. Don\u2019t worry \u2018bout breaking nothin, some of those things
    have been kicking since before you were even thought about. Their names are engraved
    on the feet if you\u2019re looking for them. Lights drop at 9:30 sharp, but take
    until then to work on that script and get a hang of the puppets. Shout if you
    need anything!"
